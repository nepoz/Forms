Following changes have been made to the original:

1. Created buttons to submit and clear forms, placement needs editing

2. Started assigning names to Entry fields so that they can be referred to during templating

3. Edited some blanks in Dakhila to have Jinja template formatting

Changes that still need to be made:

1. Need either more symbolic entry labels, or need to make sure order of blanks on the form and 
order of entry fields matches up exactly

2. Some way to make the "miti" fields clearer: ask person who has given the project?

3. Obtain final versions of all forms and enter formatting syntax, implement entry field names
for other form GUIs

4. Split multi-page forms so that we have one window corresponding to one page, perhaps some way 
to go from one to the next? A button or something?
